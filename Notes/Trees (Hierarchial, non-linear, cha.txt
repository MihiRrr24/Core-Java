Trees (Hierarchial, non-linear, chaining in data)

-> Data values are being connected in the form of nodes
-> Every node will be having a parent and children as null 
-> Non linear, hierarchial data structure
	use to implement datbases, file systems
-> Deletion & insertion is a hectic task to perform



root (parent)
edge
parent
child
subtree (left or right subtree)
ancestor
descendent
leaf node (no child)
 


Types of Tree -
1. Binary Tree (atmost 2 -> 0, 1, 2) child nodes
2. Binary Search Trees (left me small value than parent node and right should be greater)


Two types of traversal -> 
1. DFS (Depth First Search)
2. BFS (Breadth First search)


DFS types - 
node is always root node
1. Preorder (Node, left, right)
2. Inorder(LNR)
3. Post Order (LRN)

Remember jaha bhi null hoga wo usko chhor kr peeche waale node pr jayega

When doing tree questions
edge case -> think where that function will be null
where it is null what we have to do
recursion call return k saath krna h ya nhi
